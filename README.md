# Advent of Code Template

A simple template for an https://adventofcode.com/ code runner

## Usage

1. Create a [new repo](https://github.com/tannerstephens/aoc-template/generate) with this template
2. Once you have the repo cloned down, you can run `aoc.py` with any Python>3.7
3. Create a new day with `python aoc.py -c 1`<br>This will create a `day1` folder
4. In that folder, place your part 1 code inside the `part1` function
5. Run `python aoc.py` to run the most recent days solutions

You can run all days solutions in series with `python aoc.py --all`

You can also run a specific days solution with `python aoc.py --run <day_num>`
